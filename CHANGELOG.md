## Unreleased

### Added
- Added optional ENV variable `CONSENT_GRID_ESTIMATE_ONLY`. If the variable has the value `1` then the DataGrid only displays the estimated number of records and has a simplified pagination (only the " previous " and " next " buttons). Enabling this variable solves the performance problem when displaying the DataGrid if there are already too many records in the database.

### Removed
- Removed ENV variable `GRID_COUNT_LIMIT`. The limit is now always `100 000` when the `CONSENT_GRID_ESTIMATE_ONLY` variable is disabled.

### Changed
- Changed minimum PHP version to `8.3`.
- Changed `68publishers/php` Docker images to the latest versions.
- Updated composer dependencies and codebase syntax (typed constants, readonly classes etc.).
- Email notifications are not sent for disabled projects.

### Fixed
- Fixed broken styles in notification emails.
